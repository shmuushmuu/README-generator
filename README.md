 ## Description
The project was to make a README generator using node. I loved it. I like node,
and I think Node likes me. We're getting pretty serious.

I used inquirer to have the user interact with the questions I came up with through node.
I sent their answers to an fs file maker, and that's all she wrote.
Enjoy making README's (the easiest part of coding) as easy as you can imagine.
